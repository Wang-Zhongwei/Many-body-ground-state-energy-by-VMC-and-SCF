@article{Review_of_VMC,
 abstract = {This topical review describes the methodology of continuum variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations. These stochastic methods are based on many-body wavefunctions and are capable of achieving very high accuracy. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel and well suited to implementation on petascale computers, and the computational cost scales as a polynomial in the number of particles. A guide to the systems and topics which have been investigated using these methods is given. The bulk of the article is devoted to an overview of the basic quantum Monte Carlo methods, the forms and optimization of wavefunctions, performing calculations under periodic boundary conditions, using pseudopotentials, excited-state calculations, sources of calculational inaccuracy, and calculating energy differences and forces.},

    abstract = { This paper considers the problem of minimizing a function F(x1, …, xn) over a closed, bounded region S in n-dimensional space under the assumption that there exists a unique minimizing point (z1, …, zn)ϵS. In a previous paper I represented the coordinates of the minimizing point as the limit of a ratio of integrals. The same type of ratio appears, in a different context, in statistical mechanics where a Monte Carlo method has been developed, by Metropolis et al., for its numerical evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to point out the connection of Metropolis's method with the above type of minimisation problem. The idea of the method is to associate with the minimization problem a Markov chain whose sample averages converge with probability one to (approximately) the minimizing point (z1, …, zn). The Markov chain should be easily realizable on a computer. An estimate of the error from sampling over a finite time period is given. }
